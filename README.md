# Evil Overlord MOTD

Because I'm both easily amused and constantly using a terminal, I like to do
silly things when it comes to the MOTD on my terminal. Probably the silliest:

Combine [Peter's Overlord
List]('http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html') with ASCII art of
Darth Vader and cowsay.

That's something you'd like to see, you cry?  Well, I've made it easy for you
to do this for yourself!

## Setup

You'll need to be on Mac OS or Un/Linux.
